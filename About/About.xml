	<description>Adds a teleport bench and its tiles to stand on.
	
Buildings :
	- Tp workstation : at least 1 is needed. It will give orders to tp spots.
	- Mini station : smaller workstation.
	- Tp spot : build it close to the workstation and choose the way it works. It is also a storage, meaning you can prioritize what pawns will put on it. You can choose to automate teleportation and the way it goes : in, out, swap.
	- Tp catcher : cheap wooden building that you can link to a tp spot. It is a storage. A pawn or any object standing on it will be teleported.
	- Tp bed : cheap building that allows to teleport wounded, incapacitated or captured pawns.
	- Tp box : same but for animals.

	- Build tp spot in workstation range (power required)
	- Build tp catcher
	- Link the tp spot to the tp catcher with a colonist
	- Select tp spot, choose the way the spot teleports.
